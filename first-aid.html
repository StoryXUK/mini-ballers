                                <h2>First Aid Policy</h2>
                                <h1>A. Introduction</h1>
    <p>Mini Ballers accepts the responsibility to ensure adequate provision of first aid to both employees and participants alike. It also recognizes that beyond the immediate response to injury or illness, there is an important pastoral element to the provision of first aid, to both participants and staff, and that high-quality provision forms an integral part of making this a happy sports club. First aid is therefore undertaken in recognition of the need for privacy and by a well-qualified professional.</p>

    <h1>B. Who is First Aid qualified?</h1>
    <p>The First Aid & Resources Assistant is Harriet Elworthy who is a qualified first aider.</p>

    <h1>C. Injuries</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Illness or Minor Injury: Children/staff will be seen by The First Aid & Resources Assistant.</li>
        <li>If there is any form of injury to the face and head, The First Aid & Resources Assistant or the lead first aider on site if The First Aid & Resources Assistant is not available, will assess the injury. Any head or face injury will be reported to parents by phone or email, informing them of the injury and any treatment so far. A head injury form will be sent home with the child, outlining symptoms to look out for.</li>
        <li>More serious injury, particularly to the neck, back, head, or leg: the child/staff must not be moved and should be made as comfortable as possible. The First Aid & Resources Assistant must be called to assess the situation. The decision to summon an ambulance will be made by The First Aid & Resources Assistant.</li>
        <li>An ambulance should be called for any injury or illness which lies beyond the scope of the first aider present; if in doubt staff should err on the side of caution and call an ambulance.</li>
        <li>Hygiene / Infection Control: where there is a spillage of bodily fluids, (e.g. blood, vomit, urine, or stools) staff should in the first instance keep children well away. Using appropriate protective clothing, the spillage will be cleared up.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is Mini Baller’s policy where diarrhoea and vomiting have occurred that all children are sent home as soon as possible. Children and staff must not return to the club's activities until 48 hours after the last bout of diarrhoea or vomiting. Should a child or member of staff return before the 48-hour period, they will be asked to return home.</p>

    <h1>D. Provision of intimate care</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>In the event that intimate care is required, privacy for the pupil will be provided.</li>
        <li>Where regular assistance with intimate care is required (e.g. for the application of creams), this will only be undertaken on the instruction of parents and in line with their instructions, and will only be undertaken by those appropriately qualified and with due regard to the pupil’s privacy and dignity.</li>
        <li>In the event of a toileting accident, a child will be given support that recognises their need for privacy and dignity. If needed, support will be given by no more than one member of staff, but where possible pupils will be encouraged and supported to change themselves.</li>
        <li>Where there is a need for an older pupil (7 and above) to be examined by a First aid trained member of staff, a second member of staff of the appropriate gender may be asked to attend, but only with the permission of the pupil and if at all possible, the pupil’s parents. If in any doubt, any such examination will be left to the parents or the emergency services unless the urgency to provide first aid overrides all other considerations.</li>
        <li>In the event of intimate care being given, parents will be informed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>E. Medicines</h1>
    <p>There are occasions when pupils may need to bring medication into the club when recovering from an illness. Therefore, all parents are asked to complete a 'Parental Consent for Administration of Medication' form containing their child/children’s medical details. Any medication must be handed to the club leader with the parent consent form/letter outlining the nature of the illness and the time of the dosage plus any relevant information. We cannot accept responsibility for any medication unless written permission is given, with full details including both the date and duration.</p>
    <p>Parents whose children are prescribed inhalers are required to fill out a 'Parental Consent for Administration of Medication' form, informing staff of dosage and timing. All medicines are stored in accordance with product instructions and in the original container in which they were dispensed and parents’ advice i.e. medical plan should be stored with it.</p>

    <h1>F. Use of Adrenaline Auto-Injectors (e.g. EpiPen/Jext)</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>An auto-injector is used to give an emergency dose of adrenaline in the event of an anaphylactic shock. This is a severe allergic reaction to a stimulus (e.g. foods, insect stings and synthetic materials etc) and may be characterised by sudden swelling, difficulties breathing, rash, disorientation, panic or even loss of consciousness.</li>
        <li>Mini Ballers has taken the following steps to ensure that those who have been prescribed adrenaline auto-injector pens (AAIs) can be given quick and prompt treatment in the event of an anaphylactic shock in school or on school trips:</li>
        <li>An AAI will only be used on a pupil/member of staff whose name appears on the box, unless otherwise advised by the emergency services.</li>
        <li>Staff have been trained to use AAIs and if available should be asked to carry out the administration – time is of the essence, and if no trained member of staff is available immediately, Mini Ballers authorises any member of staff to use the adrenaline auto-injector, following the instructions given with the adrenaline auto-injector and under the instruction of the emergency services.</li>
        <li>The emergency services must be informed and preferably prior to administration; in all cases of use, the recipient will be admitted to hospital by ambulance.</li>
        <li>All packaging must be retained and the AAI made safe, to be sent with the paramedics on admission to hospital.</li>
        <li>Parents must be informed at the earliest opportunity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>G. The First Aid responsibilities for the staff member on duty</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Give first aid as required.</li>
        <li>Fill out the accident/injury form for any incident they deal with. Any treatment of note requires an accident report to be written. They also need to write a note informing parents of an injury and need to record this on the accident sheet.</li>
        <li>Parents are informed of any first aid treatment: head and face injuries by phone and head bump by email/letter. All other injuries are reported

 at the end of the day, verbally and by note.</li>
        <li>Parents or next of kin are contacted if the injury needs further monitoring or treatment.</li>
        <li>A Head Injury Letter is sent to parents for any form of injury to the face, neck, or head.</li>
        <li>Where hospitalisation is required, the Lead First Aider will accompany the pupil or member of staff to the hospital. The remaining staff on site will liaise with the parents/next of kin and the first aider will wait for the parents or next of kin’s arrival before returning to the clubs.</li>
        <li>Ensure that first aid procedures are understood and adhered to by all staff and that appropriate training is provided as required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>H. Health-related dietary requirements</h1>
    <p>If a parent has informed the club via the Medical Information Form or in writing that their child has a dietary issue that will affect their health or well-being, the child’s name will be added to the dietary list which alerts staff members that the pupil has a specific dietary need that must be monitored.</p>
