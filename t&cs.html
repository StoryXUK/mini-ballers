                                    1.1 What these terms cover. These are the terms and conditions on which we supply
                                    our Mini Baller (“Classes”) and general services (“Services”) to you as a consumer.<br>

                                    1.3 How to contact us. You can contact Harriet Elworthy using the contact details
                                    which can be found under the contact tab on this website.<br>
                                    1.4 Definitions. The following definitions and interpretations shall apply
                                    throughout these terms:<br>
                                    1.4.1 When we use the words "writing" or "written" in these terms, this includes
                                    emails.<br>
                                    2. Our contract with you<br>
                                    2.1 Our contract with you Your order (and any Contract formed as a result) shall be
                                    between you and Harriet Elworthy of Mini Ballers<br>
                                    2.2 How we will accept your order. Our acceptance of your order will take place when
                                    we email you to accept it, at which point a contract will come into existence
                                    between you and us (the “Contract”). At this point payment for a full term of
                                    classes is due.<br>
                                    2.3 If we cannot accept your order. If we are unable to accept your order, we will
                                    inform you of this (including why we cannot accept your order), and will not charge
                                    you for the Services.<br>
                                    2.4 If you continually cancel orders placed with us or breach our terms. We
                                    understand that there may be many valid reasons for you to cancel or request to
                                    change the date and time of your Class place. However, the nature of our Classes
                                    means there are limited spaces, and we rely on customers keeping to their arranged
                                    Classes where possible. If you continually cancel your Class place without a good
                                    reason, we reserve the right, at our absolute discretion, to not accept further
                                    orders from you. We also may at our absolute discretion, not accept further orders
                                    where you have previously committed a material breach, or repeated breaches of these
                                    terms.<br>
                                    2.5 Intellectual property rights belong to us. All intellectual property rights in
                                    our Classes or any other Services, including any materials provided to you in our
                                    provision of the same belongs to Mini Ballers. Unless otherwise permitted by these
                                    terms, you must not permit any other person to use or benefit from any materials or
                                    information provided to you in the course of us providing you with our Services.<br>
                                    2.6 Photography and media use. Parents are welcome to take photos and videos of
                                    their child throughout any of our Classes, and to share these on social media or
                                    with their friends and family. However, this is at the sole discretion of Harriet
                                    Elworthy Leader, who may withdraw this right at any time where a parent is acting
                                    unreasonably (for example, preventing or delaying us providing the Class, taking
                                    excessive amounts of photos, videoing whole segments of our Classes, or taking
                                    photos or videos of other children without their parent’s permission).<br>
                                    3. Our Services<br>
                                    3.1 Services may vary slightly from their description on the website. The

                                    your care or supervision are able to take part in our Classes or any other Services
                                    which you order from us, and that it would not be harmful to either your or your

                                    not be liable for any loss, injury or damage suffered where you do not tell us about
                                    a medical condition, or you or the child do an activity which you are aware (or
                                    should have been aware) would, or might be, detrimental to you or the child.<br>
                                    3.3 You and your child use our Services at your own risk. You and any child for
                                    which you are responsible use our Services and attend our Classes at your own risk

                                    skill and care, we will not be liable to you for any loss, damage or injury suffered
                                    by you or a child for whom you are responsible as a consequence of you not following
                                    our instructions during the provision of our Classes or Services.<br>
                                    3.4 You shall not allow your child to attend a Class if they are ill. You must not
                                    bring your child to a class in the following circumstances:<br>

                                    and the content of, our Classes) will be as set out on our website. Please note that
                                    the provision of our Services are subject to change from time to time.<br>
                                    4.2 Classes are provided as a term unless agreed otherwise. When you place an order,
                                    you purchase a set of Classes together (a “Term”).<br>
                                    4.3 When you purchase a Term of Classes. Your Term will commence on the date of the
                                    first Class. We will supply our Services to you until either the Services are
                                    completed and your Term expires, or this Contract is otherwise brought to an end by
                                    you or us under these terms.<br>
                                    4.4 We are not responsible for delays outside our control. If our supply of the
                                    Services is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon
                                    as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the
                                    delay. These steps may include offering rescheduled dates for the Classes. Provided
                                    we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by the event, but if there is a
                                    risk of substantial delay and we are not able to reschedule the Classes, you may
                                    contact us to end the Contract and receive a refund for any Services you have paid
                                    for but not received.<br>
                                    4.5 If you do not allow us to provide Services. If you miss a Class (and you do not
                                    have a good reason for this), we are unable to provide a refund for any Services
                                    which you paid for but did not receive. See clause 6.2 for classification of good
                                    reason.<br>
                                    4.6 What will happen if you do not give required information to us. We may need
                                    certain information from you so that we can supply the Services to you, for example,
                                    the names of any children attending our Classes, existing medical conditions, and
                                    any immunisations given to your child. We will not be responsible for supplying the
                                    Services late or not supplying any part of them if this is caused by you not giving
                                    us the information we need within a reasonable time of us asking for it.<br>
                                    4.7 Your rights if we suspend the supply of Services. We will contact you in advance
                                    to tell you we will be suspending supply of the Services, unless the problem is
                                    urgent or an emergency. If we have to suspend the Services for any substantial
                                    period of time, we will adjust the price so that you do not pay for Services while
                                    they are suspended.<br>
                                    4.8 Your rights if we withdraw the supply of Services. We will contact you at least
                                    7 days in advance to tell you we will be withdrawing the supply of Services. If we
                                    withdraw the Services we will cancel the Contract and refund any sums you have paid
                                    in advance for Services which will not be provided.<br>
                                    4.9 We may also suspend supply of the Services if you do not pay. If you do not pay
                                    us for the Services when you are supposed to under these terms and you still do not
                                    make payment within 7 days of us reminding you that payment is due, we have the
                                    discretion to suspend supply of the Services until you have paid us the outstanding
                                    amounts. We will contact you to tell you we are suspending supply of the Services.<br>
                                    5. Our Class Cancellation Policy<br>
                                    5.1 We may allow you to cancel your Class place. Subject to the remaining terms of
                                    this clause 5, we may allow you cancel your Class, or any Class within a Term, but
                                    this remains at our absolute discretion at all times.<br>

                                    14 day cooling-off period (see clause 6.3), you shall not be entitled to a refund in
                                    any respect when you cancel your place under this clause 5.<br>

                                    5.4 We may re-sell your place when you cancel. Where you cancel your Class place, we
                                    may at our absolute discretion try to sell your Class place to another customer.
                                    Where we are successful in doing so, we shall refund you for the Class which you
                                    have cancelled. A refund in any other circumstances where you cancel a Class shall
                                    be at our sole and absolute discretion.<br>

                                    you at any time for any reason by giving us notice in writing. Where you give us
                                    notice that you would like to end the Contract, this will be with immediate effect
                                    unless you have stated otherwise in your notice to us. When you cancel under this
                                    clause you will not be entitled to a refund of any payments you have made in respect
                                    of the Services, whether such Services have been received or not, and you may have
                                    to pay us an administration fee, to cover the costs we will incur as a result of
                                    your ending the Contract.<br>

                                    to suspend them, in either case for a period of more than 30 days; or<br>

                                    in which case we will refund any payments made for Services which have not been

                                    12.3 Nobody else has any rights under this Contract. This Contract is between you
                                    and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms. Neither
                                    of us will need to get the agreement of any other person in order to end the
                                    Contract or make any changes to these terms.<br>
                                    12.4 If a court finds part of this Contract illegal, the rest will continue in
                                    force. Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or
                                    relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs
                                    will remain in full force and effect.<br>
                                    12.5 Even if we delay in enforcing this Contract, we can still enforce it later. If
                                    we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these
                                    terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this
                                    Contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not
                                    prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a
                                    payment and we do not chase you but we continue to provide the Services, we can
                                    still require you to make the payment at a later date.<br>
                                    12.6 Which laws apply to this Contract and where you may bring legal proceedings.
                                    These terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in
                                    respect of the Services in the English courts. If you live in Scotland you can bring
                                    legal proceedings in respect of the Services in either the Scottish or the English
                                    courts. If you live in Northern Ireland you can bring legal proceedings in respect
                                    of the Services in either the Northern Irish or the English courts.<br>
                                    Photographs and Recordings<br>
                                    Occasionally, we may take photographs or video recordings of the pupils attending a
                                    Mini Ballers class or event. We will always inform parents first before we do this.
                                    We may use these images in digital or physical marketing material such as Facebook
                                    or Instagram reels, to show our classes in action. They may also be used in other
                                    printed publications that we produce, as well as on our website. Please let us know
                                    if you do not want your child to be included in these photographs or short
                                    recordings.
